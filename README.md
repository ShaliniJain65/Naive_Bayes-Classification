# Naive_Bayes-Classification

The aim of this project was to design a classifier using Naive Bayes Approach to classify the data. 
The Data which is to be classified was IMDB movie review data sets having 50000 train and test data.
After Analysing the train data, we have to classify whether the movie review is positive or negative without using any libraries. 
Test Accuracy was 83% approx.
Precision and Recall were plotted on a curve graph for user analysis.
Also Was able to get the top 20 positive and negative words out of the 50k text files(Data).
